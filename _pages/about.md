# Welcome!

<!-- I received the M.S. degree and Bachelor degree in computer science from The University of Hong Kong and [Jinan University](https://english.jnu.edu.cn/), respectively. -->
I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. degree with the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervised by [Prof. Francis C.M. Lau](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/fcmlau) and [Dr. Yupeng Li](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-Yupeng-LI.html).

My research interests include robust machine learning and online algorithms (including learning-augmented online algorithms).

If you are interested in my works or looking for some discussions, please let me know by [email](mailto:wdacheng@connect.hku.hk) at any time.
